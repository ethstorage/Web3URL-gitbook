# Chrome extension

A [Chrome extension](https://github.com/ComfyGummy/chrome-web3) is available to browse ``web3://`` websites. 

**This extension is not yet safe for widespread use.** Many functions that should enforce cross-origin isolation currently do not properly do this. This extension still fails to display some ``web3://`` sites properly. Until all of this is fixed, it will not be available on the Chrome web store. You may still compile it manually and use it for demonstration purposes.
