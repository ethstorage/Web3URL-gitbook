# Register Your First W3NS Name

## Introduction

The [W3NS](https://w3ns.w3q.w3q-g.w3link.io/) is the name service on Galileo. In short, you are able to give your wallet address a name. This is much like how the traditional web works with DNS. All websites are hosted at an IP address but no one actually puts that in their browser, instead, we use names such as google.com or amazon.com.

## Registering .w3q Domain Names <a href="#f67b" id="f67b"></a>

The core functionality of the W3NS is registering .w3q domains. There are a few important rules to keep in mind when it comes to registering domains on the W3NS:

1. The minimum domain length is 3 characters.
2. Annual renewal fees. 3 characters: 128 W3Q/year, 4 characters: 32 W3Q/year, 5+ characters 1 W3Q/year. The minimum renewal duration is 1 month.&#x20;

## Creating and Managing Domains

Registering a domain is extremely easy using the [W3NS app](https://w3ns.w3q.w3q-g.w3link.io/). First search for the W3NS name that you’d like. If it is not taken, you will be presented with this screen.

Once there you can click request to register which will trigger a transaction, wait 20 seconds, and then you can register the name. It’s now yours.

Now that you own a .w3q domain, you want to enable all the cool features that it offers. This starts on the domain management screen.

There is a lot going on so let’s put all of the pieces together:

* Owner: can set the editor address, and transfer the registration to someone else. This is the ultimate owner.
* Editor: essentially handles the “day-to-day operations” of the domain.
* Expiration Date: when your renewal fee is due and you can pay it here as well.
* Resolver: handles resolving (translating) the records put below such as what Galileo address is tied to this domain. Should be set as the public resolver which will be the default option when clicking the Set button.
* Web handler: After migrating your website to Galileo, you can set the contract address to this field, and then you can visit it by the name in the [Web3URL gateway](https://w3link.io).

Congrats, you have owned a W3NS name and configured it properly!
