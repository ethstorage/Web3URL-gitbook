# Resolve mode

To know how to interact with a smartcontract, the ``web3://`` protocol needs to determine the **resolve mode** of a smart contract.

There are 3 resolve modes:

- **auto**: The smartcontract is generic and has not implemented a interface defined by the ``web3://`` protocol. In this case, we will craft the URL path in a specific way to indicate the name, arguments and return signature of the method we want to call on the contract. [Read more about it](./mode-auto.md)
- **manual**: The smartcontract has implemented a specific interface, and is now able to handle any path: ``/abcd``, ``/aa/bb/cc?xx=yy`` are valid paths. For each path, the smartcontract is free to return a different result, like what a traditional web app would do. [Read more about it](./mode-manual.md)
- **resource request**: The smartcontract has implemented a specific interface, and is now able to handle any path. The main difference with **manual** mode is that most of the path processing (path splitting, query argument extracting) is done browser-side. ðŸŸ  This resolve mode is in draft status (ERC-6944), but is not expected to evolve much. [Read more about it](./mode-resource-request.md)


## Resolve mode determination by clients

To determine the resolve mode of a smartcontract, the ``web3://`` client will call first the smartcontract with this method signature : 

```
function resolveMode() external returns (bytes32);
```

- The manual mode will be used if the `resolveMode` return value is `0x6d616e75616c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, i.e., "manual" in bytes32
- The resource request mode will be used if the `resolveMode` return value is `0x3532313900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, i.e., "5219" in bytes32
- The auto mode will be used if :
    - the `resolveMode` return value is `0x6175746f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, i.e, "auto" in bytes32, or
    - the `resolveMode` return value is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, or
    - the call to `resolveMode` throws an error (method not implemented or error thrown from the method)
- Otherwise, the protocol will fail the request with the error "unsupported resolve mode".


## Find out a contract resolve mode

You can use the [web3curl app](https://github.com/web3-protocol/web3curl-js) in verbose mode to determine the resolve mode of a smartcontract. For example : 

```
web3curl -v 'web3://w3url.eth'
...
* Resolve mode determination... 
> 0xdd473fae
< 0x6d616e75616c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
* Resolve mode: manual
...
```

In this example, we see that we sent ``0xdd473fae`` to the smartcontract, which is the call to ``resolveMode()``, and the smartcontract returned ``0x6d616e75616c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000``, which, according to the rules above, let us know that the smartcontract is in **manual** mode.
