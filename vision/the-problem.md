# The Problem

When 99% of the users follow the above steps to interact with the blockchain, one critical problem shows up: **the dApp servers / NSPs are centralized!** This means that the benefits of the decentralized blockchain can be easily broken:

* **The dApp servers / NSPs have all read access information of dApp**, which are unavailable to others, i.e., similar to Web2, they could use the data for their own benefits (perhaps analyze and sell them?)!
* **The dApp servers / NSPs can still censor the content of blockchain!** E.g., Uniswap delists 100 tokens on their website last year (See [https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/mapping-out-eth-2-0/3-reasons-why-uniswaps-token-delisting-sparked-controversy/](https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/mapping-out-eth-2-0/3-reasons-why-uniswaps-token-delisting-sparked-controversy/)). Another recent example is that the author Signal, a privacy IM, wrote a [story](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) about his first impression of Web3, where the NFT he created was delisted by OpenSea (and then delisted on MetaMask) although he has no idea which user term he violates!
* **The dApp servers / NSPs may even provide malicious content!** Since they are running on centralized servers, they can be hacked and provide wrongful information to users without notice! E.g., recently Klayswap website was [hacked](https://klayswap.medium.com/klayswap-incident-report-feb-03-2022-f20ba2d8e4dd) by replacing the protocol’s address with the hacker’s address. As the result, the users may unconsciously approve (allow someone to use) their assets to the hacker, who laters stole them!

So one may ask why not the users run their own blockchain nodes and interact with the blockchain in a fully trustless way? As summarized by [Moxie](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html), there are a couple of root causes that we may never circumvent:

* **Users or even dApp projects will not run their own blockchain nodes.** Maintaining the servers can be costly and time-consuming even for nerds or organizations, and also requires some levels of expertise that most users lack. The node may stop working if it runs out of memory or storage. It can further halt if the node software is not correct or outdated (as each time Ehtereum forks). This results in the popularity of cloud services, wallets, and NSPs
* **The development behind the centralized servers is much faster than developing a decentralized platform.** The success key of Web2 companies such as Google / Facebook is to faster iterate the product behind servers, while it takes years to build a smart contract platform (Ethereum) or decentralized storage (IPFS/AR).
